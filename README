ANaConDA (Adaptable Native-code Concurrency-focused Dynamic Analysis)
=====================================================================
ANaConDA is a framework that allows one to easily create dynamic analysers for
analysing multi-threaded C and C++ programs on the binary level. It provides a
monitoring layer offering notifications about important events, such as thread
synchronisation or memory accesses, so that developers of dynamic analysers
can focus solely on writing the analysis code.
